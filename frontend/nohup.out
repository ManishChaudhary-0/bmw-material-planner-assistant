MUI: The LocalizationProvider component was moved from `@mui/lab` to `@mui/x-date-pickers`.
The component will no longer be exported from `@mui/lab` in the first release of July 2022.

You should use `import { LocalizationProvider } from '@mui/x-date-pickers'`
or `import { LocalizationProvider } from '@mui/x-date-pickers/LocalizationProvider'`

More information about this migration on our blog: https://mui.com/blog/lab-date-pickers-to-mui-x/.
